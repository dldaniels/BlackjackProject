## Lessons Learned
The biggest lesson learned here is how incredibly difficult it is to focus your attention on a project like this in one weekend when you are a father of four boys in a small 3 bedroom house that will never leave you alone. Finding any focus or time to just kind of get in the zone was a challenge. I spent most of the weekend with this on the struggle bus simply because I was being pulled so many other directions....even as I write this at 2 am i think my kid woke up wanting to watch Spongebob...but enough about my wild life.

I learned more about the game of Blackjack than I had ever known before. Some actual lessons learned though. I still seem to fumble through some concepts and sort of get them but sort of not get them and use the tools of eclipse to help me out in completing certain things that sometime work and sometimes do not work. Sometimes I have no clue why they do or do not work and just kind of go with it. After it is completed though it is kind f easy to read through and get a better understanding so for that reason I really dig the help eclipse gives.

I feel like the concepts that were built upon the past few weeks especially when it comes to the APIE stuff are really coming together a little more clearly even If I sometimes get frustrated because I feel stupid, it still makes more sense to me today than it did last week. This weekend and this project are something I wish I could get a do over on and I wish this looked and functioned a bit better with some better styling and more of the stretch goals but I can always edit it later if I get the time.



## How to Run
Blackjack project is a game of blackjack with the User(Player) playing against a dealer. The dealer has a standard 52 card deck and deals a hand to the player and to themself. The dealer shows only one card initially while the players two card value is shown. The goal is to reach a point total of 21 without going over. If no one reaches 21 then the winner will be whoever is holding the highest amount of cards without going over 21. Going over 21 is considered a loss for player or dealer.

Upon starting blackjack user is asked if they want to play or quit. The user will be prompted to enter Y to play or N to quit. User elects to play and gameplay is initiated. Once a winner is determined the player can elect to play a new hand or quit. When the hand is dealt the player has the option to hit(deal more cards) or stand (keep only the cards they have) The user can select H to hit or S to stand. This will continue until the player elects to quit.
